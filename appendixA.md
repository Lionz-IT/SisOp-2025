## Computer System Structures  

This section provides a summary of the key concepts from Appendix A, based on *Operating System Concepts* by Abraham Silberschatz.

### 1. Computer-System Operation  
- **I/O Operations and Interrupts:** Devices communicate with the CPU using interrupts to perform efficient I/O operations.  
- **Storage Structure:** Overview of memory hierarchy, including main memory, cache, and secondary storage.  

### 2. Operating-System Operations  
- **Multiprogramming and Multitasking:** Allows multiple programs to run concurrently, improving CPU utilization.  
- **Dual-Mode Operation:** Introduces user mode and kernel mode to enhance system security and stability.  

### 3. Process and Thread Management  
- **Process Concept:** Covers the process life cycle (new, ready, running, waiting, terminated) and process control blocks (PCB).  
- **Threads:** Describes single-threaded vs. multi-threaded processes and CPU scheduling techniques.  

### 4. Memory Management  
- **Virtual Memory:** Concept of paging, segmentation, and address translation, allowing programs to use more memory than is physically available.  
- **Memory Allocation:** Strategies for memory allocation, including fixed and dynamic allocation, and issues like fragmentation.  

### 5. Storage and File System Management  
- **File Systems:** Explanation of file storage, directory structures, access methods, and file system mounting.  
- **Mass Storage Structure:** Managing secondary storage devices, disk scheduling algorithms, and reliability.  

### 6. Protection and Security  
- **Access Control:** Mechanisms to protect data and resources, including user authentication and permissions.  
- **System Security:** Common security threats and the role of the operating system in mitigating them.

## Operating System Timeline  

Below is a timeline of key milestones in the development of operating systems:

### 1950s: The Dawn of Operating Systems  
- **1956:** *GM-NAA I/O*, one of the first operating systems, designed for batch processing.  

### 1960s: Multiprogramming and Time-Sharing  
- **1961:** *CTSS* (Compatible Time-Sharing System) enables multiple users to share CPU time.  
- **1969:** *MULTICS* pioneers multi-user systems and influences UNIX.  

### 1970s: UNIX and Personal Computing  
- **1971:** *UNIX*, developed by Bell Labs, introduces multitasking and multi-user functionality.  
- **1974:** *CP/M* becomes a popular OS for early microcomputers.  

### 1980s: GUI and Commercial Operating Systems  
- **1981:** *MS-DOS* is adopted as the standard OS for IBM PCs.  
- **1984:** *Mac OS* introduces a GUI, making computing more accessible.  
- **1985:** *Windows 1.0* brings a GUI interface to Microsoft's OS.  

### 1990s: Internet and Open-Source OS  
- **1991:** *Linux Kernel* is released, starting the open-source OS movement.  
- **1995:** *Windows 95* brings the Start Menu, taskbar, and plug-and-play hardware support.  

### 2000s: Modern Operating Systems  
- **2001:** *Windows XP* gains popularity for its stability and ease of use.  
- **2001:** *Mac OS X* combines a UNIX foundation with a sleek GUI.  
- **2007:** *iOS* launches with the iPhone, transforming mobile computing.  
- **2008:** *Android* OS, based on Linux, powers smartphones globally.  

### 2010s: Cloud Computing and Mobile Domination  
- **2011:** *Chrome OS* focuses on cloud computing, powering Chromebooks.  
- **2015:** *Windows 10* introduces a unified experience across devices.  
- **Present:** Linux powers most servers, cloud services, IoT devices, and supercomputers.
